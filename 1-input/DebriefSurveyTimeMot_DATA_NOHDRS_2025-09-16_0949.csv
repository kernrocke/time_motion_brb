One notable case involved a sensitive situation with a pregnant woman who required imaging. The doctor maintains a professional manner.    Overall, the department was quite busy. Due to limited treatment rooms, the doctor had to attend to patients in the corridors.  Referrals were initiated in the Accident and Emergency Department, where the medical consultant on call approached the doctor on duty to identify patients who could potentially be discharged.  Additional referrals were communicated via the AED operator, signaling the medical team to the AED, where referral information was taken in person.  I observed that certain administrative process were still manual.  For example, the doctor had to deliver the request for patient notes to the clerk or the consent form for imaging to the orderly, who then took it to the radiology department. These process  while functional, contributed to delays and increased work load.  One of the significant challenge was waiting  for the test results before patients could be referred to the medical team. This delayed the decision-making and caused the doctor to extend her shift beyond the scheduled end time. Uncertainty regarding the availability of medical supply and relevant created inefficines.Additionally, the doctors' workstation was very noisy and crowded, with multiple doctors discussing cases simultaneously.  Finally, the exit survey was conducted in a private setting, ensuring that there were no interruptions.          ",0

This was beneficial in ensuring the participation felt comfortable and speak freely.  However, the room physical environment posed a challenges.  The temperature was notably cold, which may have impacted both the participant's comfort and the overall duration of the survey.  Additionally, the office was somewhat cluttered. Two filing cabinets stood against the wall, with a file sort organizer on top containing various continuous forms. Towards the back of the office, a glass cabinet displayed additional folders.  A white notice board nearby was covered with flyers an notices. On the wall, a single sheet of paper listing the department was taped directory, possibly intended to provide quick reference but contributing to the overall visual clutter.The office contains two desk, each holding large and small notebooks along with two desktop computers.  While the space was functional, the overall disorganized layout may have subtly distracted the participant.  From an operational standpoint, two nurse managers were on duty, and the workload was divided and executed, with the participant performing several administrative duties such as updating the off-duty book with the previous week's roster, recording sick leave and training sessions, and consolidating absence form for submission.Throughout the shift, while carrying out these administrative responsibilities, the participant experienced multiple interruptions from subordinates who came to request medical supplies such as Beta-dine and other ward items, as well as made complaints regarding work related issues. These ongoing interactions not only divided the participant's attention but contribute in delays in completing assigned tasks.  This likely affected the flow and depth of  the engagement during the exit survey.  The participant needed to follow up with a doctor from the psychiatric hospital regarding the availability of bed to facilitate the transfer of a patient from the accident and emergency Department (AED).Additionally, the pharmacist requested that the AED nurse manager to submit the Monday pharmacy stock request, as the pharmacy personnel is not on duty. The participants also responded to a clinical emergency.Furthermore, one Emergency Room Technician/Orderly requested that a nurse accompany a patient to the CT Department, as the nurse assigned to that area ad not yet arrived on duty.These tasks further illustrate both the multitasking nature of the role participant's role and the unpredictable nature of the department .  Finally, the survey interview was conducted while participant were actively with for the other nurse manager to return  with the statistical data and other supporting in formation for the report.  This waiting period introduced a sense of frustration and could disrupt the flow of the exit process.  In conclusion, factors such as environmental discomfort, clutter, multitasking demands and the unpredictable nature of the clinical environment may have significantly influenced the quality and depth of responses provided in this exit survey.",2

The environment offered limited privacy, but interruptions were minimal.  The timing of the survey  - immediately following a particularly demanding shift - likely impacted the participants' willingness and capacity to engaged fully.  The shift was marked by consistently high patient volume, even though most cases were not critical.the constant flow of the patient created a busy atmosphere, with added strain due to spatial limitations.  At several points, ambulance gurneys remained occupied due to the lack of bed forcing staff to search for suitable areas to accommodate incoming patients.  Compounding the spatial challenges were moments of supply shortages.  Essential medical supplies such as betadine and urinals were not readily available and had to be source from other areas, causing delays and increasing staff workload.These logistical issues may have contributed to the Participant fatigue and affected the tone or depth of feedback during the survey.  An intercom announcement by the doctor shift leader requesting that the relatives of stable patients remain outside highlighted ongoing effort to manage space and maintain order, further reflecting the operational pressure faced by the participant.  Despite these challenges, the triage nurse demonstrated a high level of engagement and professionalism.   The a participant under took my responsibilities, from patient registration and hygienic support to clinical tasks such male catheterization preparation, emptying urinals, sample collection, writing  lab   request.  The participant focused and pro active stood out, yet the overall intensity of the shift may have influenced perceptions shared during the exit survey.

This location ensured confidentiality.  There were no verbal interruptions; however the ambient noise - such as the sound of the ventilator and cardiac monitor-was present in the background.  Relevant observation and factors potentially affecting the survey response:  1. Environmental stressors:The high volume and overcrowding likely elevated the participants stress levels, which may influence the tone or completeness of the response during the exit interview.  2. Physical and mental fatigue:   Constantly moving between treatment areas and the intensity of cases (assisted the medical team with an intubation procedure, initiated  continuous positive airway pressure, addressed a patient who eager to self- discharge, conducted supervisory teaching with s doctor and initiated care for a pregnant inmate) could have contributed to physical and cognitive fatigue, potentially affecting the depth or clarity of the responses.  3,  Clinical interruption risk:  although there were no interruptions during the survey, the setting's proximity to cardiac monitor and ventilator alarms may have affected the participant's ability to fully disconnect from the clinical context to reflect impartially.  Spatial Limitations:  the continuous search for appropriate space to assess patients reflects systematic inefficiencies that may have shaped the participant's perceptions about the working environment and healthcare delivery.  5.

Technological disruptions:  internet connectivity issues prior may have caused stress and cognitive fatigue, which could subtly influence the participant's reflection or willingness to elaborate during the exit survey.  2.  Transition from academic to clinical role: the quick shift from conference presenter to clinician may have limited the provider's mental decompression time, potentially influencing the participant focus or emotional availability during the exit survey.  3.  Patient location challenges:  the lack of clear patient assignment and the need to seek assistance from. Patient advocate disrupted the workflow, possibly contributing to frustration or decreased efficiency.  4.  Inadequate physical space:  the reliance on non-traditional   Treatment rooms (such as the triage room) due  room unavailability reflects systemic capacity constraint.  These limitations may influence how the participant evaluates the working environment or organizational support during the exit survey.  5.  Limited patient encounters:  the participant had two patient encounters which occurred within a two-hour period.

Environmental Distractions:Multiple interruptions during the survey including inquiries from other staff members and ongoing administrative tasks.  Such a setting can divert the participant's attention and hinder thoughtful reflection, potentially leading to incomplete responses.  2.  Time constraints:  the necessity to complete administrative duties within a limited timeframe could have pressured the participant to expedite  the survey, possibly resulting in less detailed answer.  3.  Survey fatigue:  The participant may have been experiencing general fatigue from administrative duties, this may have led to disengagement or reduced effort in responding to the exit survey.  4.cognitive load:  the participant's engagement in multitasking during the survey increases cognitive workload, which may have impaired the ability to process and respond the response to the survey questions effectively.  5.  Concurrent task engagement : The participant was involved in preparing the report for the Senior Nursing Officer and the incoming nursing just before the survey.   Balancing these responsibilities may have limited the participants' capacity to engage fully with the survey questions, affecting the depth and accuracy of the responses.   6.  Lack of privacy:  conducting the survey in a non-private setting may have inhibited the participant from discussing sensitive issues openly, due to concerns about confidentiality or potential repercussions.

While another nurse managed patients arriving by ambulance.  During this period the nurse faced increased responsibilities due to the reassignment of due to an reassigned of one of the triage nurses and the need to supervise a student phlebotomy nurse.   These factors contribute to a high stress environment, potentially impacting the participant's engagement during the exit interview.    Potential influencing factors   1.  Cognitive load and fatigue.  The participants expanded duties including managing patient assessment and reassessment, communicating effectively with patients in the waiting area,requesting lab, performing  urinalysis and ECG, redirecting patients to their assigned area within the hospital, likely led to cognitive overload and fatigue.  Such conditions can impair concentration and recall memory recall, resulting in brief or no reflective interview responses. Also, engaging in a training session amidst a high demand work environment can contribute to cognitive overload.  The additional mental effort to absorb new information during a busy shift may lead to fatigue, reducing the participant's capacity for reflection and thoughtful responses during the exit interview.    2. Time constraint and environmental factors:   Interviewing in a clinical environment, even in a private area, my have imposed time pressure or distractions, limiting the depth of the participant 's responses.  The anticipation of returning to duties or the presence of clinical activities further constrained the interview's effectiveness.  3.  Delayed reflection:  the nurse's subsequent  provision of responses via what's app suggests that additional time allowed for more thoughtful reflection. This delay indicates that exit survey may not have captured comprehensive insights as the participant may have had time to process the shadowing experience fully.

Shadowing Experience  Time : approximately 10:00 to 2:00 pm (Approximately 4 hours)  During the observation period, the clerk performed a wide array of administrative functions critical to the clinic's patient flow and service delivery. These responsibilities were Carr out with efficiency and adaptability in a fast-paced environment.  Key tasks included :  Printing document for collection by  a Ministry of Health personnel     Creating and updating  patient's paper-based or electronic   files     Searching and retrieving physical documentation    Registering patient for various services ( e.g general clinics, child health visits, nutritionist clinic, or home visits)    Scheduling and mangling appointments dates  Offer directions for patient who are not familiar with the clinic layout     Supervising and mentoring a Student Medical Clerk during daily operations.    Managing incoming calls and routing message appropriately     The clerk displayed strong multitasking skills, often addressing real- time inquiries while simultaneously managing documentation with minimal delay.    Background     Children's waiting area   Staff raised concerns that multimedia content on the mural in the children's area was outdated.  They recommended integrating mor current, child- friendly cartoons to better engage children during their visits.    IT and equipment limitations   Multiple laptops within the Poly clinic were reported non- function and awaiting technical servicing.    Documentation Practices  Inconsistent practices by physicians were noted, particularly the failure to log out digital sessions after entering notes, leaving records open and vulnerable.    Staff also reported that only one doctor routinely completes documentation after clinic hours or the next day.    It was suggested that diagnoses should be recorded o. Separate times to enhance clarity and ease of digital filing.    Relevant observations and factors affecting responses    Environmental disruptions  The clerk's station was positioned in a high traffic area, with frequent interruptions from phone calls, walk-in queries and internal requests,  These distractions likely influenced the general tone of some responses.    Simultaneously Mentorship Role:  While managing core responsibilities, the clerk also supervised a Student Medical Clerk, which added an educational dimension to the workload and may have impacted of some tasks.

Post Lunch Interview Timing  Conducting the I terview shortly after the lunch break my have influenced engagement - potentially creating na more relaxed but time- conscious interactions.         Personal reflection   This was my time documenting data electronically during the shadowing of a clerk, and I found the process more challenging than than expected. At times, it felt tedious and repetitive, and I struggled to clearly identify specific tasks being performed  - especially  as many duties overlapped or occurred simultaneously.  Despite this, the experience gave me a realistic view of the demands placed on health care staff and emphasized the importance of attention to detail and adaptability when working with electronic system.         attention ntomdetail  ",2

In addition to the planned consultation, the physician accommodated several walk-in patients.  \nMy shadowing session began approximately two hours after the physician's shift started and lasted four hours.  During this time, a variety of patient cases were managed.one notable encountered involved a patient with hypoglycemia, who a,though exhibited a low blood sugar level, remained alert and responsive.  Another significant case involved a patient with a dry cough who was found to be hypoxic upon examination. Due to the severity of this case, the patient was urgently referred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) for further management.\nThe physician attempted to arrange ambulance transportation via the QEH ambulance service, but the first call was unsuccessful due to a lack of ambulance availability. Despite this logistical setback the physician remained composed and effectively managed the patient's care appropriate measures were secured.\nAt one point during the observation, the physician was called away from her office to assist with the sitting of an intravenous (IV)  for a child in another consultation room.  This interruption was handled promptly, demonstrating her versatility and teamwork across clinical settings.\n\nThe Exit survey summary \n\nThe exit survey was conducted in the physician's office immediately following the management of the hypoxic patient.  The environment was calm, with minimal interruptions - limited to a brief phone call, a quick visits by  a colleague.\nDuring the exit survey, the physician raised concerns about inadequate communication between QEH  and the Polyclinic. Specifically, discharge summaries from QEH often lack sufficient  clinical information, making it difficult for primary care providers to administer appropriate follow-up care.  \n\nKey Observations and influencing factors\n\nDelayed start time:  Shadowing began two hours after the physician's shift commenced, limiting exposure to early- morning patient flow and potentially omitting important workflow observations.\nMixed patient load:  the physician balanced scheduled appointments with several walk-ins, adding unpredictability to the workday.  This mix may affect provider stress levels.\n\nEmergency Case Management and logistical Delays: the urgent referral of a hypoxic patient, coupled with initial ambulance unavailability, disrupted the normal clinical routine and may have impacted the physician's workload  and emotional tone during subsequent interactions.\n\nCognitive load and continuity:  the need to transition quickly between routine care, emergency response, and assisting another physician in siting IV for patient in another area of the clinic.  This brief interruptions showcased her adaptability and willingness to support colleagues, but may have contributed to task-switching fatigue or momentary shifts in concentration.\n\nSystemic Communication Gaps\nThe physician expressed clear dissatisfaction with the quality of discharge summaries from QEH, which was described as lacking essential clinical details for adequate follow-up care.  This systemic issue is likely to influence provider attitudes towards hospital- community care coordination and may have shaped the tone and content of the feedback provided during the exit survey.\n\nCalm debriefing environment \nDespite a busy session, the exit survey was conducted in relative quiet location with minimal interruptions. This allowed for focused reflection and thoughtful responses, which likely increased the quality and depth of feedback obtained.\n\n\n\n\n",0

During this period, I was able to observe routine nursing assessments, paper-based and electronic documentation practices, patient education and procedural support in a busy primary care setting.\nThe nurse began by using the MedData System to identify the next patient awaiting nursing assessment. Once the patient was called into the room vital signs, weight, blood sugar check and reason for visit were obtained.\nDuring the assessment, one patient presented with complaints of wheezing.Upon auscultation the nurse noted the chest was clear.  However to ensure thorough evaluation, the nurse requested that the physician to confirm the patient was not wheezing.\nAnother notable observation involved the identification of a data error -  patient's date of birth was incorrectly recorded in the Med Data system.

This system flawe appeared to dominate her feedback, suggesting it is a recurring issue that significant impacts het workflow and documentation quality.\n\nElectronic Data Correction \nThe recent experience of correcting an error in the Med data system heightened the nurse' awareness of the document ration challenges.  This may have influenced her to emphasize the limitations such ad inability to record subcutaneous injection during the survey.\n\n\n\nAdaptation to Physician Shortage \nThe need to adjust to a physician shortage and facilitate catheterization procedures with limited resources likely contributed to the nurse's stress level and focus .  This situation  may have made her response more concise and problem oriented, particularly around staffing flexibility and support.  The nurse appeared accustomed to such scenarios, suggesting that adapting to resources limitations had become a routine part of her professional environment.\n\nTeaching and Supervision Duties\nThe nurse's attention was divided between clinical care and student supervision, which may have limited the depth and length of her response  during the exit survey.  Her focus on mentoring likely influenced how she prioritized and reflected on key issues.\n\nClinical Judgment  and Collaboration \nThe nurse's decided to consult with a physician after assessing a wheezing patient reflected a proactive approach to patient care.  This experience may have shaped her responses to highlight the importance of inter professional communication and the need for clear documentation protocols.\n\n",0

I was subsequently directed to the records clerk.  I introduced myself and explained the purpose of my visit.  I was then informed that doctor in charge was not on-site at the time.  The clerk contacted her by phone, and she indicate that the doctor would arrive within half an hour.\n\nAt approximately 11:15 a.m., the head of the clinic arrived. However, I was informed that shadowing could not proceed that day, as the staff  had not been officially notified of the research.   The doctor attempted to contact a records clerk by phone to determine whether I could begin shadowing in that department, but there was no response. It was therefore mutually agreed that I  would commence shadowing on Monday, July 7, 2025.\n\n\nWhen I returned on Monday, I was provided with a list of participants along with their designated shadowing days.  However, shadowing could not proceed as planned due to an unexpected plumbing issue - a burst pipe in the pharmacy - which led to patient congestion at the facility's entrance and disrupted normal clinic operations.\n\nShadowing Experience - July 8, 2025\nI returned on Tuesday, July 8 2025, and was initially assigned to a nurse working in the Child Health Clinic.  Upon informing the health Sister that my assignment was to observe a nurse providing care primarily to adult pt, I as reassigned to a Barbadian Registered Nurse working in a room labeled 'Emergency Room/ Blood Collection Room'.  Although I was originally scheduled to shadow her on Wednesday during her phlebotomy duties, I was permitted to observe her on that day instead.\n\n Clinical Environment Description \n\nThe emergency/ blood collection room was small and multifunctional, primarily used for triage and  minor procedures.   It contained oxygen cylinders, a desk,cupboards, a Dina map for monitoring vital sign, an emergency trolley. The counter top is the designated  area for  storing blood and other specimen samples.  At the back room, a small space housed general stock and pharmacy supplies  contributing to the room's practical yet compact setup.\nAdjacent to this space was the record clerk's room, which also housed the recorded area.  This area was somewhat noisy at times, which occasionally interfered w communication between staff and patients.\n\nClinical Shadowing Activities \n\nAt the start of the 4 hr shadowing  session, the nurse explained her routine prior o my arrival, which included:\n- Cleaning and preparing the workstation \n- Ordering medical supplies and pharmacy stock (utilizing a paper based methods)\n- Taking a break\n\nDuring the shadowing session, I observed the nurse performing various tasks, such as\n- measuring and electronically recording vital signs  \n- conducting and electronically recording physical assessments based on the patient complaints \n- weighing patients\n- performing urinalysis and blood glucose\n- conduct patient education based on needs\n- engaging in professional communication with the staff and patients\n- assisting with the preparation of dressing sets for sterilization, in anticipation of the next day's dressing clinic.\n- documenting clinical finding using med data\n\nObservation Affecting Shadowing\nSeveral  factors were observed that may have impacted the overall shadowing experience \n\nLack of advance communication:  Staff were not informed in advance about the shadowing schedule, which led to confusion and initial denial of access.  This highlighted the importance of internal communication between administrative staff and clinical leadership.\n\nInfrastructure Issues:  the burst pipe at the pharmacy July 7 disrupted normal operations band patient flow.Patient had to wait outside, leading to increased stress for staff and patients. This environmental disruption directly impacted the feasibility of conducting shadowing activities that day.\n\nSpace constraints: the room used for observation was small multifunctional.  The limited space and lack privacy may have affected the quality of the interactions and procedures, and I turn, restricted my line of sight during the some patient encounters.\n\nhigh patient volume\nThe clinic was busy, and the nurse being shadowed had to multitask frequent.  While this provided valuable insight into real- world workflow, it also limited opportunities for in-depth explanation or teaching moments.\n\nResource limitations \nThe use of paper-based record, limited equipment and reliance on manual processes reflect systemic resource constraint. These limitations influenced the nurse's workflow and affected the overall efficiency of care delivery.\n\nNoisy Environment \nAlthough the nurse preferred using the emergency/blood collection room over the other triage room due to its relative quietness from external traffic noise, it was adjacent to the records room, which occasionally became noisy due to conversations and phone calls.  The nurse noted that while  the room offer some insulation from outside disturbances, the internal noise from the adjacent records area sometimes disrupted communication with patients.  She mentioned that she could request the record clerk to lower their volume when necessary to maintain a more conducive clinical environment. This background noise created a distracting background that at times disrupted communication between the nurse and her patients.  The background noise also made it challenging to fully engaged in observe sensitive clinical interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n",0

The room was small and contained a filing cabinet, a desk with a desktop computer, a dinamal, a scale and a sink.  It was located to a high- traffic area, and the door remained open throughout the session. While this allowed patients to access the room freely, it raised concerns about privacy for those being attended to.   The room was also used by other staff members to wash their hands, further disrupting the triage process and compromising confidentiality.\n\nTasks Observed\n\nThe triage nurse was observed performing several responsibilities, including:\n\n- Measuring and electronically recording patient's vital signs\n- Conducting physical assessment based on patient complaints \n- Weighing patients \n- Performed urinalysis \n- Providing patient education\n- Communicating professionally with staff and patients \n- Administering medication to a patient in an adjacent room\n- Responding to a patient who became diaphoretic while waiting to fill a prescription at the pharmacy, after being summoned by the security guard.\n\nRelevant observations affecting the Shadowing Experience\n\nNoise and Distractions \nThe triage room's proximity to a busy hallway and the fact that the door was left open may have affected the confidentiality of sensitive discussions, while roadside traffic  made it difficult to hear patient- nurse interactions. \n\nLimited Physical Space\nThe compact size of the room restricted movement and created a somewhat crowded working environment. Despite this, the nurse managed the space efficiently.    However, the confined area made it more challenging to observe certain  procedures up close.\n\nShared room usage\nThe room served multiple functions throughout the day, such as handwashing by other staff, leading to occasional interruptions and minor delays in the patient flow during triage assessments.\n\nTeam Dynamics \nDespite  environmental limitations, the team display strong collaboration.   The phlebotomy (general trained nurse assigned take patient's blood) after completing her own tasks, voluntarily assisted the triage nurse, enhancing workflow and patient management.\n\nAdditional notes \nAt the end of the shadowing sessions, some patients were still waiting to be triaged.
